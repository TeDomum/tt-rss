## Contributing code the right way 

New user accounts on Gogs are not allowed to fork repositories because of spam. To get
initial fork access, do the following:

1. Register on the forums and on Gogs
2. Create a thread describing your proposed changes in Development subforum while
including your Gogs username
3. If your changes make sense to me, I'll update your repo limit and you'll be able to
fork things and file pull requests

If you already have a fully functional Gogs account it works pretty much like Github:

1. Fork the repository you're interested in
2. Do the needful
3. File a pull request with your changes against master branch

That's it. If you have any other questions, see this forum thread:
